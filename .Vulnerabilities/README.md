## Vulnerabilities
# Some Vulnerabilites found on this Site are mentioned below:





## 1. Content Security Policy
# Content Security Policy (CSP) header not implemented
Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature in web browsers that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by limiting the resources (e.g., scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) that a web page can load. It does this by allowing web developers to specify which origins (e.g., domains) are allowed to be loaded by their web page.

When a web page sends a Content Security Policy header in its HTTP response, it tells the browser which origins are allowed to be loaded. If a resource is loaded from an origin that is not on the allowed list, the browser will block it from being loaded, which can help prevent XSS attacks.

If the Content Security Policy header is not implemented, it means that the web page is not restricting which resources can be loaded, and is therefore potentially vulnerable to XSS attacks. Without a CSP, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, which could then execute in the context of the page and steal sensitive user information or perform other malicious actions.


## 2. HTTP Strict Transport Security
# HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header not implemented
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security feature that helps prevent attacks such as SSL stripping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by ensuring that all communication between the web server and the client is encrypted over HTTPS. When a web server sends an HSTS header in its HTTP response, it tells the browser that all future communication with that server must use HTTPS for a specified amount of time.

If the HSTS header is not implemented, it means that the web server is not enforcing HTTPS for all communication, and is therefore potentially vulnerable to SSL stripping and MITM attacks. Without HSTS, an attacker could intercept the initial HTTP request and downgrade the communication to an unencrypted HTTP connection, allowing them to view or modify the content of the communication.


## 3. X-Frame-Options
# X-Frame-Options (XFO) header not implemented
X-Frame-Options (XFO) is a web security feature that helps prevent clickjacking attacks by ensuring that a web page can only be loaded within an iframe from the same origin. When a web server sends an XFO header in its HTTP response, it tells the browser whether or not the web page can be loaded in an iframe from a different origin.

If the XFO header is not implemented, it means that the web page can be loaded in an iframe from a different origin, potentially allowing an attacker to create a hidden or transparent iframe and trick the user into clicking on a button or link on the web page that the user did not intend to click on.

Implementing XFO can help prevent clickjacking attacks by ensuring that the web page can only be loaded within an iframe from the same origin. The XFO header can be set by the web server, and it specifies whether or not the web page can be loaded in an iframe from a different origin. There are three possible values for the XFO header:

DENY: The web page cannot be loaded in an iframe from any origin.
SAMEORIGIN: The web page can only be loaded in an iframe from the same origin.
ALLOW-FROM uri: The web page can only be loaded in an iframe from the specified uri.
It's important to note that the ALLOW-FROM value is not supported in modern browsers due to security concerns, and it is recommended to use either the DENY or SAMEORIGIN value instead. Additionally, it's important to test the XFO header to ensure that it is properly implemented and preventing clickjacking attacks.


## 4. X-XSS-Protection
# X-XSS-Protection header not implemented
X-XSS-Protection is a web security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by telling the web browser to enable its built-in XSS protection mechanism. When a web server sends an X-XSS-Protection header in its HTTP response, it tells the browser to enable its XSS protection feature, which can help detect and prevent certain types of XSS attacks.

If the X-XSS-Protection header is not implemented, it means that the browser's built-in XSS protection mechanism may not be enabled, leaving the web page potentially vulnerable to XSS attacks. Without XSS protection, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, which could then execute in the context of the page and steal sensitive user information or perform other malicious actions.

Implementing X-XSS-Protection can help protect against certain types of XSS attacks by enabling the browser's built-in XSS protection mechanism. The X-XSS-Protection header can be set by the web server, and it specifies whether or not the browser should enable its XSS protection feature. There are three possible values for the X-XSS-Protection header:

0: Disable XSS protection.
1: Enable XSS protection, but don't block the entire page if an attack is detected.
1; mode=block: Enable XSS protection, and block the entire page if an attack is detected.
It's recommended to use the value 1; mode=block to enable the browser's built-in XSS protection mechanism and block the entire page if an attack is detected. Additionally, it's important to test the X-XSS-Protection header to ensure that it is properly implemented and protecting against XSS attacks.

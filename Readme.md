## Vulnerabilities Detected in the Project

### 1. Hardcoded .npmrc AuthToken

The `.npmrc` file is used to configure settings for the `npm` package manager, including authentication tokens. Hardcoding an authentication token in this file can create a security vulnerability because it can be easily accessed by anyone who has access to the project's code.

**Solution:**

The best solution to this issue is to remove the authentication token from the `.npmrc` file and use an environment variable to store the token. This way, the token will not be visible in the `.npmrc` file and will be more secure.

Here are the steps to follow:

1.  Remove the authentication token from the `.npmrc` file.
    
2.  Set an environment variable to store the authentication token. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell profile (e.g. .bashrc, .zshrc):
    
    `export NPM_TOKEN=<your authentication token>`
    
    Replace `<your authentication token>` with your actual token.
    
3.  Modify your `.npmrc` file to use the environment variable. Replace any instance of the authentication token with `${NPM_TOKEN}`. For example:
    

    
    `//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}` 
    
    This will tell npm to use the value of the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable as the authentication token.
    
4.  Save and close the `.npmrc` file.
    

By using an environment variable, you can avoid having your authentication token hardcoded in your `.npmrc` file, which can make it more secure.

### 2. HSTS is Not Enabled

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security mechanism that helps to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and other security vulnerabilities. When HSTS is enabled, a website's server sends a header to the user's browser telling it to always use HTTPS when communicating with the server.

**Solution:**

To enable HSTS in your project, you need to add the following header to your server's response:


`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>` 

Replace `<expire-time>` with the number of seconds that the browser should remember that the site is only accessible via HTTPS. For example, if you want the browser to remember for a year, you can set `<expire-time>` to `31536000`.

If you are using a web server like Apache or Nginx, you can usually enable HSTS by adding a few lines to your server's configuration file.

For example, to enable HSTS in Apache, you can add the following lines to your `.htaccess` file:


`<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=<expire-time>"
</IfModule>` 

Replace `<expire-time>` with the number of seconds that you want the browser to remember that the site is only accessible via HTTPS.

Enabling HSTS can help to improve the security of your project by preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and other security vulnerabilities.



### 2. Use of Hardcoded Credentials

Hardcoding credentials in your code can create a security vulnerability because it can be easily accessed by anyone who has access to the project's code.

in `src\App.js` : `6:7`

``` const password="v6faF+gC7Zs@?VyCqtEYQ%?S" ``` 

   
**Solution:**

To address this issue, it is recommended to store the credentials in a secure location such as a configuration file, a database, or an environment variable. This would make it harder for attackers to access the credentials, as they would need to have access to the secure location in addition to the code.

In this case, the hardcoded password in `src\App.js` can be moved to a configuration file or an environment variable. For example, you could create a `.env` file in the root of your project, and define the password as an environment variable:`PASSWORD=v6faF+gC7Zs@?VyCqtEYQ%?S`

Then, in `src\App.js`, you can retrieve the password from the environment variable using `process.env.PASSWORD`:`const password = process.env.PASSWORD;`

By using this approach, the password is not exposed in the code and is only accessible through a secure mechanism.
